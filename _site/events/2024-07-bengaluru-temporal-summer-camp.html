<ul>
  <li><strong>Durable Execution: What, Why and How? Event driven orchestration with Temporal and Kafka</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Speaker:</em> <strong>Avinash Upadhyaya, Platform Engineer, Platformatory.io</strong></p>

<p><em>About the talk:</em> In this 101-level talk, we will discuss the need for durable execution engines such as Temporal. We will explore the basic building blocks of Temporal and demonstrate use cases for Temporal. Finally, we will look at building event driven applications using Temporal for execution and Apache Kafka for messaging.</p>

  <li><strong>Temporal: The Swiss Army Knife for Platform Engineering</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Speakers:</em> <strong>Tarun Annapareddy, MSCS at University of Colorado, Boulder, and Nishanth Nalluri, Platform Engineer, Nutanix</strong></p>

<p><em>About the talk:</em>  This Talk explores how Temporal serves as a “Swiss Army knife” for platform engineering, providing robust support for durable execution and fault-tolerant workflows across diverse use cases.</p>

<p>We delve into multiple real-world use cases where Temporal’s capabilities are leveraged to enhance system reliability and developer productivity. From managing and automating CI/CD pipelines to orchestrating long-running business processes and ensuring data consistency across distributed systems.</p>
