<div class="about">
Hello Bengaluru
<br /><br />
We're excited to bring to you a new series of events in Bengaluru focused on data streaming and adjacent technologies. Our objective is to share knowledge and provide a platform for thought leadership around:
<br /><br />
Event Streaming Technologies (Apache Kafka and more)<br />
Event Driven Architecture<br />
Stream Processing<br />
Streaming Databases<br />
Real-time analytics<br />
Data Mesh<br />
..and more.
<br /><br />
We're hosting our next in-person event on October 28. Join us for exciting discussions in the streaming world with opportunities to network with peers and leaders in the industry.

<h3 id="talks">Talks</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Advanced analytics with Flink and Kafka</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Speaker:</em> <strong>Vijay Narayanan, Staff Solutions Engineer at Confluent</strong></p>

<p><em>About the talk:</em> This session will start with an overview of Flink and how Flick and Kafka come together to provide stream processing. We will dig into some interesting and unique capabilities in Flink and end with a short demo.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>hi-performance data pipelines with Rust+Haskell+Kafka</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Speaker:</em> <strong>Paul Victor, Senior Architect at Juspay</strong></p>

<p><em>About the talk:</em> Juspay’s data platform handles 5 million transactions/day and close to 1 billion events from various microservices both on the customer device SDK and application servers. The stream of events are used to power realtime analytics to merchants while optimizing on metrics like performance(which indirectly translates to cloud costs), accuracy and realtimeness. We chose haskell and rust as the language of choice to run the backbone of our data processing application. The raw CPU performance of these data processing applications is tremendous and has helped us reduce our cloud costs. There are challenges in architecting such applications as we steered clear of traditional data processing frameworks, which I will briefly talk about.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pinot , Why are you so fast</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Speaker:</em> <strong>Jayesh Asrani, Solutions Architect at StarTree</strong></p>

<p><em>About the talk:</em> Apache Pinot Engine 101 , Query Processing , optimising techniques on what makes Pinot fast with a peak under the hood of the Apache Pinot engine and what makes it lightning fast.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Building Real time ML with Kafka and Flink</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Speaker:</em> <strong>Ashwin Venkatesan &amp; Avinash Upadhyaya, Platform Engineers at Platformatory</strong></p>

<p><em>About the talk:</em> In this talk, we will explore the idea of building real time machine learning systems with Apache Kafka and Apache Flink. The objective is to demonstrate feature pipelines that compute these real-time features (using Flink) and copy (using connectors) to a feature store
a model serving layer (HTTP) that picks up real-time features and provides them as inputs to the model
model that delivers real-time prediction</p>
