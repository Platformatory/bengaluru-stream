<h3 id="talks">Talks</h3>

<p><strong>A real-time data foundation for modern banking</strong></p>

<p><em>Speaker:</em> Pavan Keshavamurthy, CTO &amp; Co-founder @ Platformatory.io</p>

<p>About the talk: Primer on Apache Kafka, the landscape of event streaming, and beyond. Cover the breadth of drivers, reference architectures, blueprints, and tooling for achieving real-time data in a financial system.</p>

<p><strong>Apache Kafka with Schema Registry and Avro</strong></p>

<p><em>Speaker:</em> Sanjay Awatramani, Staff Software Engineer I, Confluent</p>

<p>About the talk: This session will cover:</p>

<p>The motivation for using Schema Registry in Kafka based applications</p>

<p>Intro to Avro serialization format</p>

<p>The need for schema evolution as the system grows</p>

<p><strong>Push Architecture-Revolutionising app’s lengthy load time to zero</strong></p>

<p><em>Speaker:</em> Nikesh Shetty, Lead Consultant at Thoughtworks</p>

<p>About the talk: In this talk, we will explore how we leveraged Kafka and a push architecture to achieve lightning-fast mobile app launches. We’ll delve into the challenges faced with traditional app launch methods and discuss the architectural enhancements that transformed the user experience. The talk will cover the following key points:</p>

<p>Introduction to mobile app Launch challenges:</p>

<p>Designing a push architecture for app launch acceleration -How push architecture reduces latency and optimizes app launch times</p>

<p>Lessons learned and future considerations: 1. Too many and too less- how do you decide the kafka partitions 2. How do you decide on kafka topics- splitting kafka topics</p>

<p>Exploring additional use cases and possibilities with Kafka and push architecture.</p>

<p><strong>Lessons in running Kafka on Kubernetes: approaches, pitfalls, and stories from the trenches</strong></p>

<p><em>Speaker:</em> Avinash Upadhyaya, Platform Engineer at Platformatory</p>

<p>About the talk: Look at various tooling around running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes and cover best practices for running a distributed system such as Kafka on Kubernetes.</p>
